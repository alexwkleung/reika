# Agent Guide for Reika

This file is loaded automatically by Reika when it runs in this directory. Conventions and pointers below.

## Project

Reika is a minimal coding-agent CLI. TypeScript strict, ES modules, single-file-per-concern. Built around the assumption that _every token of context counts_ — designed first for small local models, and scales up to cloud.

## Design rationale: agent-first ergonomics

### Reika source code specific

Reika is meant to be edited by small local models, frequently dogfooding itself. That constraint shapes a number of choices that would otherwise be pure style preferences. The pattern: optimize for "how cheaply can an LLM with limited context understand and modify a unit in isolation."

Reika initially was intended to be edited by small local models and dogfooding itself. However, while this isn't always the case, the constraint still holds strong and shapes the number of choices that would otherwise be pure style preferences. The pattern: optimize for "how cheaply can an LLM with limited context understand and modify a unit in isolation."

- **Colocated tests** (`bar.test.ts` next to `bar.ts`) — when the model edits `bar.ts`, the test file appears in the same directory listing. With a separate `tests/` tree, models often miss the tests entirely and break them silently.
- **One concept per file, shallow directory depth (≤3–4 levels)** — a 5000-line file forces partial reads and lost context. Deep nesting adds path-traversal cost to every lookup.
- **Predictable file shapes within a category** — every tool file (`src/tools/*.ts`) exports a single `Tool` object with the same structure. The model learns the pattern once and applies it elsewhere without re-exploring.
- **Names that read like sentences** — `findFreshToolBlockStart` is faster for the model to understand than `getStart` plus a 5-line comment explaining what "start" means.
- **Comments for WHY only** — the model can read the code. Only motivation, constraint, or non-obvious-tradeoff information is new signal.
- **Skip heavy indirection** — Factory → AbstractBuilder → ConcreteImpl chains cost tokens at every layer the model traverses to find one fact. Direct code that does one thing beats reusable generics at small-model scale. The "rule of three" for extracting abstractions shifts toward "rule of five" — accept mild duplication before abstracting.

### General/agent

- **Front-load discovery into the bootstrap context** — AGENTS.md, repo map, file index, project summary all flow into the system prompt at startup so the model doesn't burn turns rediscovering structure each session.

Most of these are also just good hygiene for humans. What's different is the cost-benefit math: when the reader is an LLM with a token budget, **locality wins over modularity**, **explicit naming wins over clever naming + docs**, **direct code wins over abstraction**. When you're tempted to add a layer for cleanliness, ask: does this make the code 2× easier for a model to edit, or 0.5× easier? Often the answer is the latter.

## Code conventions

- **Formatter**: Prettier — single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, 100-col width, 2-space indent
- **Linter**: ESLint flat config with typescript-eslint + react-hooks + unused-imports rules. Unused imports are auto-removed by `npm run lint:fix` — leave that cleanup to the tool rather than manual pruning.
- **Tests**: vitest, colocated `*.test.ts` files (e.g. `client.test.ts` next to `client.ts`)
- **Pre-commit**: run `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + format:check + test)
- **Style**: functions over classes when state is minimal; classes only for things with real lifecycle (e.g. `PayloadStore`)
- **Comments**: only when explaining _why_ (constraints, non-obvious choices). Never explain _what_ — well-named identifiers do that. Never multi-paragraph.
- **Dependencies**: minimal. Adding one needs a clear reason.

## Where things live

| Path            | Purpose                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/agent/`    | Turn loop, prompt builder, mention parser, history compaction (`compaction.ts`)             |
| `src/provider/` | OpenAI-compatible client, tool-call serialization, token estimate/calibration (`tokens.ts`) |
| `src/tools/`    | One tool per file; register in `src/tools/index.ts`                                         |
| `src/context/`  | Bootstrap, repo map, file index (fdir-based), gitignore                                     |
| `src/search/`   | Web search providers — `types.ts` (interface) + per-provider adapters                       |
| `src/store/`    | Addressable payload storage                                                                 |
| `src/ui/`       | Ink components (`.tsx`) + UI helpers (`.ts`) — helpers are UI-coupled, keep them here       |
| `evals/`        | Fixture-based agent evals; runner + per-fixture files                                       |
| `src/types.ts`  | Shared types: `Message`, `Tool`, `Config`, `ContextBundle`, etc.                            |

## Adding a new tool

1. Create `src/tools/<name>.ts` exporting a `Tool` (see `read.ts` for read-only shape, `bash.ts` for streaming + approval shape)
2. If it mutates files or runs commands, gate it via `ctx.requestApproval` — never skip the gate
3. Register in `src/tools/index.ts`'s `defaultTools(config)`. If the tool needs a credential or endpoint, branch on the config (env-var-gated registration — keeps the system prompt lean for users who haven't opted in)
4. Description must be short and action-oriented (small models pay for every token in the system prompt)
5. Add an eval fixture in `evals/fixtures/` if behavior is testable

## Optional tools and provider abstractions

When a tool wraps an external service (web search, GitHub, etc.):

- Put the provider abstraction in its own subdir (e.g. `src/search/types.ts` with `SearchProvider` interface; per-provider adapters next to it)
- The tool file (`src/tools/search.ts`) is a thin factory that takes a provider and returns a `Tool`
- Register conditionally in `defaultTools(config)` based on which credentials are present
- Multiple providers for the same role (Tavily, SearXNG, Brave, Exa…) implement the same interface; switching is config-only, no tool-layer changes

This is how `search` + `fetch_url` are wired. Two providers implement `SearchProvider`: `SearxngProvider` (self-hosted, local-first) and `TavilyProvider` (cloud, AI-optimized snippets). SearXNG takes precedence when both `REIKA_SEARXNG_URL` and `REIKA_TAVILY_API_KEY` are set. If neither is set, neither tool registers and the system prompt stays lean.

**Per-turn budget for web tools:** `runTurn` creates a `webBudget` object once per user turn and passes it through `ToolContext`. `search` and `fetch_url` increment their respective counter before running; if at max, return a budget-exceeded summary without actually calling the upstream. This prevents runaway model loops from hammering SearXNG (which proxies to Google/Bing — they rate-limit per IP, so a runaway agent can get your queries blocked at the upstream level). Caps are configurable via `REIKA_MAX_SEARCHES_PER_TURN` and `REIKA_MAX_FETCHES_PER_TURN`. Subagents get their own fresh budget (independent `runTurn` invocation).

## Adding a slash command

1. Add to `COMMANDS` in `src/ui/commands.ts` with `name` + `desc`
2. Handle in `App.tsx`'s `handleCommand` switch
3. Update the `/help` text inline in `App.tsx` so users see it

## Adding UI

- Components: `.tsx` in `src/ui/`
- Helpers: `.ts` in `src/ui/` — don't move to a generic `utils/` dir; they're UI-coupled
- Lift state to `App.tsx` for cross-component features (suggestions, approval, mode)
- Bordered boxes use `borderStyle="round"` consistently

### Ink wrapping pitfalls

Two interactions to watch for when content can wrap:

1. **`flexDirection="row"` + a wrappable Text mis-renders continuation lines** (blank lines appear between wrap breaks). Fix: drop the row layout and use a single Text with nested color segments for inline markers.
2. **Color on a nested Text doesn't survive wrapping** — the outer Text's color (or default) wins on continuation lines. Fix: put the dominant color on the OUTER Text and let inner segments override (e.g., for accent markers).

Combined pattern for "marker + body that may wrap":

```tsx
<Text color={theme.muted}>
  <Text color={theme.accent}>{'❯ '}</Text>
  {content}
</Text>
```

Don't use `<Box flexDirection="row">` to compose marker + body unless you're certain the body won't wrap.

## Theme

Semantic colors live in `src/ui/theme.ts`. Components reference them via `theme.accent`, `theme.warning`, etc. — never hardcoded color strings. The pattern:

- `accent` (magentaBright) — brand + focus (Reika title, user `▎`, selected `›`, spinner)
- `tool` (cyan) — tool activity (tool call `·` + name, tool result `↳`)
- `secondary` (gray) — muted UI text
- `warning` (yellow) — wait/caution (approval box border)
- `error` (red) — problem (error box border, diff `-` lines, WARNING heading)
- `success` (green) — positive (diff `+` lines, shell `$` prompt)

To re-theme, edit `theme.ts` only. New UI must consult these names, not introduce hardcoded colors.

## Layout

`App.tsx` sets `paddingX={1}` on its outer Box for a uniform 1-column gutter. Don't add competing horizontal padding to top-level children — bordered boxes and inline content stay visually aligned because they all live inside that single gutter.

## Modes (agent / shell / chat / plan)

Four runtime modes. Each affects what input does and what context is preserved.

| Mode              | Input behavior                                                                | Tools                                                        | History                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent` (default) | Runs through model + agent system prompt                                      | `defaultTools(config)` — full set                            | shared with shell + plan                                                     |
| `shell`           | Runs as bash directly (no model)                                              | n/a                                                          | shared with agent — shell output becomes part of agent's context             |
| `chat`            | Runs through model + lean chat system prompt (no tool-use rules, no repo map) | `chatTools(config)` — knowledge-only (`search`, `fetch_url`) | **isolated** — separate `messages` array, stashed/restored on mode switch    |
| `plan`            | Runs through model + plan system prompt; read-only, ends in a written plan    | `planTools()` — read-only (`read`/`list`/`grep`/`glob`)      | shared with agent — `/plan` explore → `/agent` executes with plan in context |

Implementation: a single `messages` state holds the active mode's history. When the user crosses the chat boundary (agent/shell/plan ↔ chat), `stashedMessagesRef` saves the outgoing side and restores the incoming side's prior history. Switching among agent, shell, and plan does not stash — they share one history (so a plan carries into agent execution); only chat is isolated. `/new` clears only the current mode's history (the other side's stash survives).

Plan mode's force-write machinery (adaptive novelty cap, reasoning→plan transform with a window-budgeted reference dump) lives in `loop.ts` behind `promptMode === 'plan'`; `REIKA_PLAN_EXPERIMENT=1` just sets the startup mode. It's gated as experimental — keep its constants and helpers together and clearly marked.

Mode switches are blocked while `status === 'busy'` to avoid mid-turn state corruption.

When adding new modes, follow the same pattern: decide which existing side it shares with (or define its own stash slot) and update the swap logic in `switchMode()`.

## Approval gate

Mutating tools (`edit`, `write`, `bash`) MUST honor `ctx.requestApproval` if present. When it returns `false`, the tool MUST exit without performing its action and emit a clear summary like `"Edit declined by user for X"`. The `ApprovalRequest` object also accepts optional `warnings` — for `bash`, dangerous patterns trigger warnings that bypass session-auto-approve.

If the tool produces a diff (e.g., `edit`, `write`), include it on the `ToolResult` via `diff: { text, path, added, removed }`. The loop attaches it to the tool message, and `Scrollback` renders the diff under the summary via `DiffView` so the user can see what was actually applied. The diff text uses the `+ `/`- `/`  ` line-prefix format produced by `buildEditDiff` / `buildWriteDiff`.

If the tool ran a shell command (e.g., `bash`), include `command: { text, outputTail, outputTruncated }` on the result. The loop attaches it to the tool message; `Scrollback` renders the command as a `$ <command>` line followed by the last ~10 lines / 2KB of output (with a truncation marker if more existed). Used so the user can reconstruct what auto-approved bash calls actually executed and produced.

**Session vs env auto-approve:** `REIKA_AUTO_APPROVE=true` skips the gate entirely (App passes `requestApproval: undefined` to `runTurn`). The session-level toggle (`/approvals on`, or the "Always (this session)" choice during a prompt) flips `sessionAutoApprove` state, which short-circuits inside `requestApproval`. Env always wins; the slash command is no-op when env is on. Status bar shows a yellow `auto-approve` indicator when either is active.

## Post-edit typecheck gate

`src/check/typecheck.ts` runs `tsc --noEmit` after a turn's edits so a weak model doesn't have to remember to verify its own work. It's a **baseline delta**: a pre-edit baseline is captured at the turn's first mutating tool call, the final state is diffed against it (keyed on file + code + message, _not_ line/col, so an edit shifting line numbers doesn't flag pre-existing errors), and only errors the edit _introduced_ are surfaced. On introduced errors the model is sent back to fix them, bounded by `MAX_TYPECHECK_GATE_ROUNDS`; past the cap it finishes dirty with a user notice. TS/JS only — the one ecosystem with a cheap incremental whole-program checker on hand.

**Everything fails open.** No tsconfig, no local `tsc`, a timeout, or a crashed process all resolve to `{ ran: false }`, which disables the gate for that turn — never an error that blocks the loop. The `reason` is REIKA_DEBUG-only; it never reaches the model or the user (so a silently-dead checker can't masquerade as a green check in the logs, but also never nags).

**tsconfig resolution** (`detectTsProject(cwd, fromPath?)`), three fail-open layers: (1) `REIKA_TSCONFIG` env override — explicit escape hatch for layouts auto-detection can't reason about, like references-only solution roots or named-variant-only projects (`tsconfig.web.json`, …) with no plain `tsconfig.json`; honored when it resolves to a real file, a stale value falls through rather than going silent. (2) Walk _up_ from the edited file to the nearest ancestor `tsconfig.json`, bounded at cwd — mirrors tsc's own resolution, so a monorepo edit under `packages/web/` is checked against that package's config even when reika runs at a root with no tsconfig. (3) Degrades to `cwd/tsconfig.json` when there's no `fromPath` or nothing is found. The loop resolves this once (from the first edited file) and pins it for both baseline and final so they diff the same config. Anchoring on the edited file — not globbing config names, not crawling down from root — is what gives "which config?" a single answer; globbing risks pointing `tsc` at a base/partial config that checks nothing and returns a false green, which is worse than not running.

## Bundle and prompt caching

`ContextBundle` is built once via `bootstrap()` and treated as stable across turns to maximize prompt caching at the provider. Don't mutate it during a session. The only legitimate refresh path is `/cd`, which re-runs `bootstrap()` for a new cwd. If you add a context source, plumb it into `bootstrap()` and the system-prompt builder; never re-fetch per-turn.

**Keep the system prompt provider-neutral.** Don't add model-specific control tokens (e.g., Qwen's `/no_think`, gpt-oss Harmony headers, Mistral instruction tags) to `prompt.ts` — they're junk text for any non-matching model and waste tokens. Inference-engine flags (`--reasoning off` for llama.cpp, `temperature`, etc.) are the right layer for model-specific tuning.

## Context management

Three layers keep a long session inside the model's window. They only engage when
`REIKA_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is set (otherwise the gauge shows absolute tokens and nothing is
capped). Each has a non-obvious invariant — don't "simplify" them without reading why:

- **Calibration** (`loop.ts`): the char/4 token estimate (`tokens.ts`) systematically
  under-counts dense tokenizers (code/JSON/CJK). After each call we learn
  `realPromptTokens / estimate` and persist it across turns (turns re-seed the full
  history from the UI scrollback, so the factor must carry over). Everything below uses it.
- **Fit-to-window payload cap** (`toolcall.ts`): fresh tool payloads are truncated to the
  room left after everything else, so a single big tool result can't overflow. The room left
  reserves `minGenTokens` for the model's reply — the same generation reserve compaction and
  the backstop use (see below). Non-fresh content is measured with the _learned_ calibration;
  the fresh allowance is converted to chars with a pessimistic floor (`CAP_DENSITY_FLOOR`) so
  a sudden dense dump can't overflow while calibration lags. The truncation marker says
  "context limit, not a command error" on purpose — without it, models loop re-running with
  different shell flags.
- **Compaction** (`compaction.ts`): once the calibrated estimate crosses
  `(window − minGenTokens) × 0.9` — i.e. when the prompt would leave less than the generation
  reserve (plus slack) — the oldest turns fold into one recap message (merged into the system
  block), keeping recent turns verbatim. It snaps the keep-boundary _back_ over `tool` messages
  to a tool-call-group start (so no tool result is orphaned from its `tool_call`) and pins the
  original user task verbatim, recapping only what follows. Snapping back rather than forward to
  a user message is what lets it compact _within_ a single long turn — e.g. a read-heavy
  plan-mode exploration that has one user message and no later boundary; the old user-only snap
  found nothing and no-op'd, so the request grew unbounded. Keep/recap budgets are sized off the
  _available_ room (`window − minGenTokens`), not the full window, so the result fits under the
  trigger even when the reserve is a large fraction of a small window. It runs on the loop's
  local history copy; the UI scrollback is untouched.
- **Generation backstop** (`budget.ts`): each turn the loop computes `max_tokens =
window − calibratedPrompt − margin` (or the fixed `REIKA_MAX_TOKENS`, whichever is smaller)
  and passes it to `callModel`. It caps a spiraling small/quantized model so it can't run to
  the context end. The cap is a _ceiling_; `minGenTokens` is the _floor_, enforced upstream
  by compaction keeping the prompt under `window − minGen` — so on a normal turn the ceiling
  already lands ≥ the floor and the cap never fires. One number, `REIKA_MIN_GEN_TOKENS`
  (default 2048), drives all three: the cap reserve, the compaction trigger, and this floor.
  Size it ~2048 for reasoning-off models, 6144–8192 for reasoning-on thinking models on a
  small window.

**Reasoning pruning** (`toolcall.ts`): historical `reasoning_content` is kept only for the
last `REIKA_REASONING_ROUNDS` tool-call rounds (default 2; the active roundtrip is always
among them — see the cross-provider note) and dropped elsewhere. Unbounded, a thinking model
accumulates reasoning every round and starves the budget; pruned to 1, it re-derives the same
analysis across rounds (and a `repeat_penalty` can't suppress what's no longer in-window).
Keeping a small recent window is the balance — raise the env var to trade tokens for
chain-of-thought continuity, lower it under context pressure.

## .gitignore is honored

Bootstrap loads `.gitignore` (and `.git/info/exclude`) into an `Ignore` instance on `bundle.ignore`. Any walker that touches the filesystem MUST consult it: `buildFileIndex` (fdir exclude+filter), `buildRepoMap` (manual walk), `list` / `grep` / `glob` tools (via `ctx.ignore`). New walkers added to tools or context modules MUST do the same — otherwise the agent burns exploration on build outputs.

## Config sources

`loadConfig()` reads dotenv from cwd `.env` first, then `~/.config/reika/.env` as fallback. Shell env vars take precedence over both (dotenv's no-override default). Order matters — don't reorder without thinking about precedence.

## Profiles

`Config.profiles` is a map of named `Profile` objects (`model` + `baseURL` + `apiKey`). The "default" profile is always present, derived from the flat `REIKA_MODEL`/`BASE_URL`/`API_KEY` keys. Additional profiles come from `REIKA_PROFILES=kimi,gpt4` + per-profile `REIKA_<NAME>_MODEL` etc.

When calling `runTurn`, App.tsx passes `resolveProfile(config, activeProfile)` rather than raw config — that overlays the active profile's `model`/`baseURL`/`apiKey` onto the rest. `/model <name>` updates `activeProfile`. Profile names are lowercased on load; matching is case-insensitive.

Subagent overrides (`REIKA_SUBAGENT_*`) are independent of profiles — they always come from the top-level config regardless of which profile is active. This is intentional: subagent model selection is a separate axis from main-thread model selection.

**Per-profile `maxTokens`:** an _explicit_ ceiling on response tokens, falling back to the global `REIKA_MAX_TOKENS`. It is no longer the only source of `max_tokens`: when `contextWindow` is set, the loop computes a per-turn backstop (`window − prompt − margin`, see the Generation backstop above) and sends `min(REIKA_MAX_TOKENS, backstop)`. With no window known and no `REIKA_MAX_TOKENS`, `max_tokens` is omitted (server default). An explicit `REIKA_MAX_TOKENS` still wins as a hard cap, so setting it too low truncates tool-call JSON silently — keep ≥4k for tool-heavy use, or just leave it unset and let `minGenTokens` size the reserve.

**Per-profile `minGenTokens`** (`REIKA_<NAME>_MIN_GEN_TOKENS`): the generation reserve, falling back to the global `REIKA_MIN_GEN_TOKENS` (default 2048). One number drives the cap reserve, the compaction trigger, and the backstop floor — set it larger (6144–8192) on a small-window profile running a reasoning model so compaction fires early enough to leave think-room.

## Tests (Vitest)

`npm test` runs all unit tests (sub-second). Covered modules with bug-prone pure logic:

- `src/provider/toolcall.ts` — `messagesToOpenAI` (assistant content nulling, tool message `name` field, payload aging)
- `src/provider/client.ts` — `sanitizeToolName`, `extractToolCallsFromContent`
- `src/ui/suggest.ts` — command + file autocomplete matching
- `src/ui/summary.ts` — session stats derivation
- `src/agent/mentions.ts` — `@filepath` expansion
- `src/search/tavily.ts`, `searxng.ts` — provider request shape + response normalization (fetch mocked)

**Not covered (deliberately):** UI components (Ink testing is awkward; evals own end-to-end behavior), tools that wrap node fs/process (read/list/grep/edit/write/bash — shallow wrappers), the agent loop itself (evals territory).

**When editing a covered module, run `npm test` before declaring done.** Tests catch regressions evals can't (evals only run when a real model invokes the broken path).

## Skills

Markdown files in `~/.config/reika/skills/` (global) and `<cwd>/.reika/skills/` (project) load as slash commands at bootstrap. Two layouts supported: a flat `name.md` file, or a directory `name/SKILL.md` (Claude Code convention — lets a skill carry supporting files which we ignore). Loader in `src/skills.ts`; bootstrap attaches the resulting `Skill[]` to `bundle.skills`. App.tsx `handleCommand` falls through to skill dispatch when no built-in matches — built-ins always shadow skill names.

When invoked, the skill body is sent as the user message (verbatim), with any args appended after a blank line. The display in scrollback shows the raw `/skill args` the user typed, not the expanded body. Uses the same `submitToModel` path as regular input, so streaming/abort/approval all work identically.

Filename validation: `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*` only. Frontmatter (optional) is parsed with a tiny hand-rolled key:value parser — no `js-yaml` dep. Per the rule-of-five heuristic, the parser isn't worth a library until skills grow nested/complex metadata.

## Eval workflow

`npm run eval` runs all fixtures sequentially against the configured model. Each fixture is self-contained: `setup` files + `prompt` + `assert`. To add one:

1. New file in `evals/fixtures/NN-name.ts` exporting a `Fixture`
2. Import + add to the `FIXTURES` array in `evals/runner.ts`

Eval timeouts use the same `AbortController` pattern as the user-side abort.

## Things to avoid

- Re-fetching project context per-turn (defeats caching, bloats history)
- Adding a mutating tool without an approval check
- Comments that explain _what_ the code does
- Backwards-compat shims and feature flags when you can just change the code
- Multi-paragraph docstrings (keep comments to one short line max)
- Premature abstraction (three similar lines is fine; abstract when the third is genuinely the same shape)

## Cross-provider gotchas worth knowing

- Reika sends no sampling params so some models may need their sampling parameters tweaked in order to reduce issues like endless loops. Not a context bug; a single runaway completion can't be interrupted between calls.
- The char/4 token estimate (`tokens.ts`) under-counts dense tokenizers — the context cap/compaction correct for it via a learned calibration plus a density floor on the cap (`CAP_DENSITY_FLOOR`). Don't drop the floor: it's what stops a dense tool dump overflowing before calibration catches up.
- Some cloud thinking models require `reasoning_content` to be roundtripped on assistant messages with tool_calls — handled in `src/provider/toolcall.ts`
- GPT-OSS on some inference engines leaks `<|channel|>` Harmony markers in tool-call names — `sanitizeToolName()` in `src/provider/client.ts` strips them defensively.
- Models without a native tool-calling template fall back to emitting calls as text; `extractToolCallsFromContent` (`client.ts`) parses the dialects (`<tool_call>{json}`, Hermes `<function=…>`, pythonic `fn(k=v)`). Thinking models sometimes leak the call into the `reasoning_content` channel instead of `content` — `callModel` recovers it from reasoning when content is empty, so the turn doesn't stall. Prefer a native template; these parsers are the fallback.
